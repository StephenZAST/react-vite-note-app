📝️ Project Description: This is a note-taking app built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The app allows users to create and manage notes, with features such as login, registration, and password recovery.

Competencies Demonstrated:

💡 Front-end Development: Utilized React to build the user interface, including components like NoteDetails.jsx, Notes.jsx, and Drawer.jsx.

🔧 Back-end Development: Employed Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, handling routes for note creation, retrieval, and deletion. Implemented authentication and authorization using Firebase Authentication.

💻 Database Management: Utilized MongoDB as the database storage solution, with Mongoose as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool.

🔩 Firebase Integration: Integrated Firebase services, including Firestore, Analytics, and Authentication, to handle user management, data storage, and analytics.

Technologies Used:

React Node.js Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Analytics) React Router DOM Key Features:

📝️ Note Creation: Users can create new notes with titles, descriptions, and tags. 🔒 Login/Registration: Users can register or login to access their notes. 💡 Note Retrieval: Users can retrieve and view their saved notes.
